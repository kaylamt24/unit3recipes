//LINK - a way to navigate to different routes in the app. Renders a hyperlink that when click, take the user to a different route in the application. Works similar to the a tag I used in my capstone to move between the homepage, ope/closed work orders as well as the customer portal.

//In the given code, the image is automatically linked to the Salmon picture rendered above. The button is a standard button that is used across the application.
